The results reveal that social media can enhance trust among employees. The direct effect on knowledge transfer was not significant but the impact was mediated by trust. 
Trust enhances knowledge exchange in the workplace with a stronger influence on the transfer of implicit knowledge rather than explicit knowledge. 
Implicit knowledge transfer was significantly related to work performance, while explicit knowledge transfer did not significantly influence work performance.
The theoretical and practical contributions of this study are discussed.
