Furthermore, the model proposed herein is fairly robust to incorrect estimations in failure rates and can still provide good predictive quality. 
Experiments are also performed to observe the relationship between multiple faults present in the same program using the concept of a failure rate. 
When predicting the effectiveness against a program with multiple faults, results indicate that not knowing the number of faults in the program is not a significant concern, as the predictive quality is typically not affected adversely.
