Our findings describe how the participant test engineers perceive software testing and deadline pressures, the challenges that they encounter, and the strategies that they use for coping with the challenges. 
The findings reveal several interesting insights. First, motivation and appreciation play an important role for our participants in ensuring that high-quality testing is performed. 
Second, intermediate onshore teams increase the degree of pressure experienced by the participant test engineers.
Third, vendor team participants perceive productivity differently from their client teams, which results in unproductive-productivity experiences. 
Lastly, participants encounter quality-dilemma situations for various reasons.
