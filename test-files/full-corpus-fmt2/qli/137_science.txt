We have built a tool that uses the novel Android mutation operators to mutate the source code of Android apps, then generates mutants that can be installed and run on Android devices. 
We evaluated the effectiveness of Android mutation testing through an empirical study on real-world apps. 
This paper introduces several novel mutation operators based on a fault study of Android apps, presents a significant empirical study with real-world apps, and provides conclusions based on an analysis of the results.
