We propose a declarative grammar-based input specification method that is based on a variation of attribute grammars and allows the user to specify input constraints in addition to input structure. 
The model can be instantiated automatically to generate structurally and semantically valid test inputs. 
The proposed method has the capability to specify test requirements and coverage criteria and use them to generate valid test suites that satisfy test coverage criteria requirements.
