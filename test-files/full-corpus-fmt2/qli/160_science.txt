Of a total of three projects, the TeGoF was applied smoothly in only one case.
However, this observation should not be interpreted as a TeGoF deficiency because its primary goal is to define a powerful detection mechanism to cope with quality-related issues in contractual relationships.
In this sense, the TeGoF proved itself as a feasible tool.
Additionally, an analysis is presented that describes the factors that contributed to the implementation difficulties of the TeGoF principles in the two remaining projects.
Finally, the relationships among trust, control and power are indicated as well as the potential influence of national, organizational and occupational culture.
