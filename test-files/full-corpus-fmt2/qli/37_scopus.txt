However, the study also exemplifies how the choice of software systems for an empirical study can influence the results of the experiments, which can serve to inform researchers to make more conscious choices in the selection of software system subjects. 
Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate how practical limitations interfere with scientific advances, branch coverage on an unbiased sample is affected by predominant environmental dependencies. 
The surprisingly large effect of such practical engineering problems in unit testing will hopefully lead to a larger appreciation of work in this area, thus supporting transfer of knowledge from software testing research to practice.
