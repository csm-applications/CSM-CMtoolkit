The result is a computationally tractable approach to symbolic execution which produces verification conditions for proving safety properties of tasking programs. 
The generation of verification conditions for the partial correctness proof is described in the paper. 
A companion paper describes the generation of verification conditions for more general safety properties. 
The isolation approach provides a basis for automating the verification of Ada tasking programs.
