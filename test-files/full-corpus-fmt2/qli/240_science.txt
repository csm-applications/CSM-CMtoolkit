In addition, case studies are presented which reveal that a test suite based on source codes can be considerably reduced using intermediate codes.
Moreover, by mutation analysis, it was found that the size of the test suite has been reduced by over 90% on average, but the fault detection capability of the reduced test suites is still approximately 80% of that of the original test suites. 
In particular, the proposed reduction method can be useful for testing compilers in the early stage of the development of retargeted compilers.
