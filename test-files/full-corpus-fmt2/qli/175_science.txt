In characterizing the system, we observed that its original, simple design was lost due to maintenance and the addition of new features.
In optimizing its architecture, we found that current models used to drive search-based software module clustering produce complex designs, which maximize the characteristics driving optimization while producing class distributions that would hardly be acceptable to developers maintaining Ant.
