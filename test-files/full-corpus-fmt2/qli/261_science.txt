The results show interesting relationships between the studied metrics and fault prediction. 
In addition to this, the performance of the introduced \{MOPSO\} approach is compared with other \{ML\} algorithms by using several measures including the area under the \{ROC\} curve, which is a relevant criterion to deal with unbalanced data.
