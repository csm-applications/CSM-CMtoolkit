The results are compared to those obtained by methods employed in the literature using case-based reasoning and stepwise regression.
Results In all data sets the empirical evaluations have shown that the proposed similarity measure and adaptation techniques method were able to significantly improve the performance of analogy-based estimation during the early stages of software development. 
The results have also shown that the proposed method outperforms some well know estimation techniques such as case-based reasoning and stepwise regression.
