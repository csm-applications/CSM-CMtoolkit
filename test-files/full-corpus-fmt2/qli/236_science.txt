A comprehensive case study with the Space program demonstrates that the new adaptive testing strategy can really work in practice and may noticeably outperform the purely-random testing strategy and the random-partition testing strategy (or collectively, the random testing strategies) in terms of the number of tests used to detect and remove a given number of defects in a single process of software testing and the corresponding standard deviation.
In addition, the case study shows that the input domain of the software under test should be partitioned non-evenly for the adaptive testing strategy.
