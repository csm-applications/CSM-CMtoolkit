Our empirical studies revealed that (1) the MDG can approximate the TSD model safely, for method-level forward dependence at least, at much lower cost yet with low loss of precision, 
(2) for the same purpose, while both are safe and more efficient than the TSD model, the MDG can achieve higher precision than the SEA with better efficiency, both significantly, and
