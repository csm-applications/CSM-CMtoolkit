The empirical evaluation was conducted based on 15 publicly available datasets. 
CCDP experiment results indicated that the proposed model achieved better overall performance than compared CCDP models. 
Statistical analysis suggested that DTB performed significantly better than WCDP models trained by limited samples and produced comparable results to WCDP with sufficient training data.
