78% of students chose to evaluate a RMT that is currently a market leader. 
62% of students subsequently recommended the adoption of their chosen RTM. 
Some students made a recommendation because the Guidelines indicated they should, rather than making a recommendation because the evidence 'entailed' that recommendation. 
Only 8% of students intentionally made no recommendation, and this seems to be on the basis of the poor quality of evidence available on the chosen RMT(s). 
All 12 students who completed the feedback questionnaire reported that this was the hardest or nearly the hardest assessment that the student had ever done! 
67% of these 12 students reported that they had not given themselves sufficient time to complete the evaluation, and 83% reported that they had to balance their time on this evaluation with other commitments. 
The 12 students found EBSE steps 1 and 4 to be the easiest and EBSE steps 2 and 3 to be the hardest, and they generally reported that they had received sufficient support from the EBSE resources made available to them
