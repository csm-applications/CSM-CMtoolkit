From 833 primary studies published between 2004 and 2014, just 17 studies regard the design of test cases for CASS.
Furthermore, some of them take into account the changes in the context by providing specific test cases for each context configuration (static perspective) during the test execution. 
These 17 studies revealed five challenges affecting the design of test cases and 20 challenges regarding the testing of CASS. 
Besides, seven TCDT are not empirically evaluated.
