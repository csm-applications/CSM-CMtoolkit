Furthermore, the proposed conversion type has been found to be more accurate than the other types when the COSMIC functional processes comprise dataset applications that are systematically larger than their corresponding FPA elementary processes, or when the processes vary from small to large. 
Finally, our proposed conversion type delivered better results over the tested datasets, whereas, in general, there is no statistical significant difference between the accuracy of the conversion types examined for every dataset, particularly the conversion type most often used is not the most accurate.
