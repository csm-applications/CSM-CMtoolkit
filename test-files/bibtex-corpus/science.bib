abstract = "The increased prevalence of digital devices with communication capability heralds the era of ubiquitous computing, as predicted by Mark Weiser. Ubiquitous computing aims to provide users with intelligent human-centric context-aware services at anytime anywhere. Optimal path planning in a ubiquitous network considers the needs of users and the surrounding context. This approach is very different from that applied by existing research on car navigation and mobile robots. This study proposes a context-aware path planning mechanism based on spatial conceptual map (SCM) and genetic algorithm (GA), referred to as UbiPaPaGo. The \{SCM\} model is adopted to represent the real map of the surrounding environment. The optimal path is planned using a GA, which is a robust metaheuristic algorithm. UbiPaPaGo attempts to automatically find the best path that satisfies the requirements of an individual user. A prototype of UbiPaPaGo is implemented to demonstrate its feasibility and scalability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of UbiPaPaGo in finding the optimal path. "

However, it seems convenient to support instructors who plan to incorporate these technologies, by conceptualizing their educational capabilities. To this end, this work addresses an approach based on the use of concept maps. During the three last years, several experiences were successfully implemented and tested in different Computing disciplines. "

This article reports the culmination of a multi-year research project aimed at developing intelligent suggesters designed to aid users of concept mapping tools as they build their knowledge models. It describes Discerner and Extender, two proactive suggesters that can be incorporated into the CmapTools concepts mapping system. Discerner applies case-based reasoning techniques to suggest potentially useful propositions mined from other users’ knowledge models, while Extender mines search engines to suggest new related areas to model. The article presents experimental results addressing two previously open questions for the project: Discerner’s retrieval accuracy and Extender’s ability to generate artificial topics with content similar to topics determined by domain experts. Both experiments show satisfactory results. "

Ad-hoc networking capabilities of handheld devices enable the development of supporting tools for collaborative work anywhere. This paper presents MCSketcher, a system that enables face-to-face collaborative design based on sketches using handheld devices equipped for spontaneous wireless peer-to-peer networking. It is especially targeted for supporting preliminary, in-the-field work, allowing designers to exchange ideas through sketches on empty sheets or over a recently taken photograph of the object being worked on, in a brainstorming-like working style. Pen-based designed human–computer interaction is the key to supporting collaborative work. The gestures-based command input results in a lightweight yet efficient and easy to use interface.

Multidimensional scaling was applied to the sorting data and a two and three-dimensional solution was computed. The three dimensional solution was used in subsequent cluster analysis and resulted in a concept map of nine “clusters”: (1) self-regulation, (2) self-perception, (3) proactive approach to health, (4) basic literacy and numeracy skills, (5) information appraisal, (6) information search, (7) health care system knowledge and acting, (8) communication and cooperation, and (9) beneficial personality traits. Subsequently, this concept map served as a starting point for developing a “qualitative” structural model of health literacy and a questionnaire for the measurement of health literacy. On the basis of questionnaire data, a “quantitative” structural model was created by first applying exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and then cross-validating the model with confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Concept mapping proved to be a highly valuable tool for the process of model building up to translational research in the “real world”. "

Despite the promise of these academic support programs in helping young people achieve their educational goals, the empirical educational research literature related to these support programs is nominal. This study employed Concept Mapping (CM) with a convenience sample of 51 foster youth/alumni in one southeastern state to explicate a conceptual framework for the development of campus supports for collegiate foster youth/alumni, and examine priority areas (e.g., importance and feasibility). \{CM\} is a mixed-method research approach that employs non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses to analyze qualitative data. As a result, visual representations of the data are computed. The final cluster map yielded an eight cluster solution: Campus Awareness, Advocacy, Data Tracking, Pre-College Supports, Fostering Family Connections, Academic Financing, Campus Life, and Peer/Mentor Supports. Foster youth/alumni in this study perceived the Pre-College Supports cluster as most feasible, while the Advocacy cluster was rated at the least feasible. The Academic Financing cluster was rated as the most important; the Campus Life cluster was rated as the least important. After a review of pertinent literature, this paper explicates \{CM\} methodology as applied to the current study, reports results, and discusses lessons learned as they apply to child welfare research and practice.

abstract = "Abstract Acquisition of knowledge must be interwoven with the process of applying it. However, traditional training methods which provide abstract knowledge have shown ineffective for gaining experience of the work. In order to solve this problem, more and more researchers have included narrative in simulation, which is known as narrative simulation. By providing the narratives, participants recognize the choices, decisions, and experience that lead to the consequences of those decisions. It has been proven that narrative simulation is very useful in facilitating in-depth learning and reflective learning. However, conventional methods of data collection and narrative construction for narrative simulation are labor intensive and time consuming. They make use of previous narratives manually and directly. They are inadequate to cope with the fast moving world where knowledge is changing rapidly. In order to provide a way for facilitating the construction of narrative simulation, a novel computational narrative construction method is proposed. By incorporating technologies of knowledge-based system (KBS), computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the proposed method provides an efficient and effective way for collecting narratives and automating the construction of narratives. The method converts the unstructured narratives into a structural representation for abstraction and facilitating computing processing. Moreover, it constructs the narratives that combine multiple narratives into a single narrative by applying a forecasting algorithm. The proposed method was successfully implemented in early intervention in mental health care of a social service company in Hong Kong since the case records in that process have structural similarities to narrative. The accuracies of data conversion and predictive function were measured based on recall and precision and encouraging results were obtained. High recall and precision are achieved in the data conversion function, and high recall for the predictive function when new concepts are excluded. The results show that it is possible for converting multiple narratives into a single narrative automatically. Based on the approach, it helps to stimulate knowledge workers to explore new problem solving methods so as to increase the quality of their solutions. "

In particular, our novel metric EntropyAvg is underpinned by the notion of entropy in information theory. A controlled experiment is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed metric. Our experimental results demonstrate that the entropy values computed according to EntropyAvg strongly correlate to individuals' problem-solving performance and that the predictive power of EntropyAvg is significantly higher than that of existing widely used concept map evaluation metrics.

Unlike other methods based on social networks or theories of information diffusion, we do not assume proximity or a pre-existing social structure to model content generation and diffusion by distributed users; instead we refer to concepts and theories from discourse psychology and conversational analysis to track online interaction and discover how people collectively make sense of novel events through micro-blogging. In particular, the proposed methodology extracts concept maps from twitter streams and uses a mix of sentiment and topological metrics computed over the extracted concept maps to build visual devices and display the conversational flow represented as a trajectory through time of automatically extracted topics. We evaluated the proposed method through data collected from the analysis of Twitter users’ reactions to the March 2015 Apple Keynote during which the company announced the official launch of several new products.

However, especially in large lectures students rarely receive feedback on their writing product. Thus, computer-based feedback could be an alternative to provide formative feedback to students. However, it is less clear, how computer-based feedback should be designed to help students writing cohesive texts. For that purpose, we implemented three different computer-based feedback methods within an authentic large lecture class. We investigated effects of the format (outline versus concept map) and the specificity (specific versus general) of the feedback on students' perceived difficulty and the generation of cohesive texts. We found that specific concept map feedback was perceived as less difficult as compared to the general feedback or the specific outline feedback. Additionally, students who received specific feedback wrote explanatory texts that were more cohesive as compared to students with the general feedback. However, the format of the feedback (concept map versus outline) did not account for improvements of cohesion. Evidently, specific concept map feedback can be regarded as an efficient scaffold to provide cohesive explanations. "

Methods To address aim one, we used group concept mapping which is a structured approach for data collection and analyses that produces pictures/maps of ideas. Fifty-eight residents developed statements about potential influences of \{HOPE\} \{VI\} on neighborhood-based physical activity. In the quantitative study, we examined whether these potential influences increased the odds of neighborhood walking/jogging. We computed block entry logistic regression models with a larger cohort of residents at baseline (n = 184) and six-months (n = 142, 77% retention; n = 120 for all informative variables). We examined perceived neighborhood disorder (perceived neighborhood disorder scale), walkability and aesthetics (Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale) and \{HOPE\} VI-related community safety and safety for physical activity as predictors. Results During concept mapping, residents generated statements that clustered into three distinct concepts, “Increased Leisure Physical Activity,” “Safe Play Areas,” and “Generating Health Promoting Resources.” The quantitative analyses indicated that changes in neighborhood walkability increased the odds of neighborhood-based physical activity (p = 0.04). When \{HOPE\} VI-related safety for physical activity was entered into the model, it was associated with increased odds of physical activity (p = 0.04). Walkability was no longer statistically significant. Conclusions These results suggest that housing policies that create walkable neighborhoods and that improve perceptions of safety for physical activity may increase neighborhood-based physical activity. However, the longer term impacts of neighborhood-level policies on physical activity require more longitudinal evidence to determine whether increased participation in physical activity is sustained.

Comprehensive program planning entailed three phases: focus groups and use of concept mapping methodology, prototype web program development, and feasibility testing of the prototype. Results of concept mapping suggested that students and experts agreed on the relative importance of the major content areas unique to the college audience. A prototype web program, informed by health promotion theories, was developed and evaluated. Students and college health professionals participated in the feasibility evaluation, which included acceptance and usability testing of the prototype. Mean scores were computed for the acceptance ratings that indicated that the prototype web program was not only feasible, but also compelling and relevant for the college audience.

This approach builds upon the hybrid interconnection of blended (b-) and collaborative (c-) learning perspectives to form an extended teaching/learning environment. The analysis axes are based on the structural characteristics of the constructed CMs, peers' interaction during the collaborative construction of CMs, and \{LMS\} Moodle use expressed via the user's Quality of Interaction (QoI). One hundred and twenty-eight participants were categorized in two groups, i.e., \{G1\} and G2, of 64 students (32 pairs) each. Both groups constructed \{CMs\} in self- (1–3 weeks) and collaborative-mode (4–6 weeks), yet \{G2\} only was instructed to additionally use \{LMS\} Moodle during the whole six-week period. The experimental results comply with the findings from previous studies regarding with the positive effect that shifting from self- to collaborative-mode has on the constructed CMs, but extends further the notion of the additional positive effect of the \{LMS\} Moodle use in the collaborative construction of the CMs, as expressed via more increased peers' turn-taking, balanced collaboration, and CM-enabled constructive, reflective and organizational interactions. It is also shown that collaboration increases \{LMS\} Moodle users' QoI. The hybrid b-/c-learning approach proposed here sets new directions towards the enhancement of \{LMS\} use and computer-based concept mapping, contributing to the enrichment of the Higher Educational Institutions services and re-examination of educational practices.

We suggest concept mapping technologies may affect self-regulated learning through enhancing these strategies to varying degrees. Computer software was particularly useful for developing cognitive strategies through ease of use. Teaching agents were particularly useful for developing metacognitive strategies by coupling visualisation of knowledge patterns with performance monitoring, aided by a teaching metaphor. Finally, mobile devices and teaching agents were most effective in enhancing motivation. Effects on knowledge gains remain unclear due to small sample sizes. "

A significant improvement has been shown in the conceptual performance in those children that constructed computer-generated maps using the system compared to those that have drawn them by hand. An evaluation was also made of the interactions between concept mapping and simulations, demonstrating that the first group of pupils performed better in simulations than the second group. Further studies are needed to study the influence of these two conditions of concept mapping on the performance of digital games. "

The current study examined students’ motivation to learn history concepts while playing a commercial, off-the-shelf computer game, Civilization III. The study examined the effect of using conceptual scaffolds to accompany game play. Students from three ninth-grade classrooms were assigned to one of three groups: one group used an expert generated concept map, one group constructed their own concept maps, and a control group used no map. It was predicted that the use of concept maps would enhance the educational value of the game playing activity, in particular students’ motivational levels; however, the opposite happened. Students who used a concept map showed lower motivation on the task relative to their baseline motivation for regular classroom instruction. In contrast, the levels of motivation in playing the game, for students in the control group, met or exceeded their levels of motivation during regular classroom instruction. These results suggest that using a conceptual scaffold can decrease students’ motivation to learn classroom material through game play, perhaps because conceptual maps can (a) focus students’ attention on the difficulty of learning the concepts and on the extrinsic rewards for playing the game and (b) make game play less autonomous, less creative, and less active. All of these can negate the primary property that provides playing its principal potential pedagogical power: fun. "

Usability addresses how appropriate (for a particular use) or how user-friendly a computer-based assessment instrument is. As we know from human-computer interaction research, if the interface is not user-friendly, a computer-based assessment can result in decreased test performance and reduced validity. This means that the usability of the interface affects the assessment in such a way that if the test is not user-friendly, then the test taker will not be able to fully demonstrate his/her level of proficiency and will instead be scored according to his/her information and communication technology (ICT) literacy skills. The guidelines of the International Test Commission (2006) require usability testing for such instruments and suggest that design standards be implemented. However, we do not know whether computer-conducted concept map assessments fulfill these standards. The present paper addresses this aspect. We conducted a systematic research review to examine whether and how researchers have studied and considered usability when conducting computer-based concept map assessments. Only 24 out of 119 journal articles that assessed computer-based concept maps discussed the usability issue in some way. Nevertheless, our review brings to light the idea that the impact of usability on computer-based concept map assessments is an issue that has received insufficient attention. In addition, usability ensures a suitable interaction between test taker and test device; thus, the training effort required for test use can be reduced if a test's usability is straight forward. Our literature review, however, illustrates that the interplay between usability and test use training has mostly been neglected in current studies. "

In two experiments, we investigated the use of examples for acquiring a new learning strategy, namely computer-based concept mapping. Experiment 1 compared learners who studied two examples on how to construct a concept map with learners who practiced concept mapping by constructing two concept maps on their own. We did not find significant differences in learning outcomes. Therefore, in Experiment 2, we introduced a third group of learners who studied examples with the additional support of self-explanation prompts. Self-explaining examples led to better learning outcomes than learning with examples without prompts or practicing. With respect to cognitive load, we found that examples without prompts released learners’ working memory compared to practicing, whereas self-explaining examples led to a higher cognitive load compared to examples without self-explanation.

Within this framework, a study was conducted to examine how learners working in dyads translated between self-generated concept maps of their own and partner's prior knowledge to create a collaborative concept map. Before individual and collaborative concept mapping (CCM) sessions, prior information on the learning topic was distributed between dyad members in such a way that they had either similar (“same/shared prior knowledge” or \{SK\} condition) or different but complementary knowledge (“different/unshared prior knowledge” or \{DK\} condition). The dual eye-tracking method was used in this study, and eye movement data was examined in two time periods, the first and second half of the \{CCM\} session. Eye movement analysis was complemented with the analysis of concept map measures, such as achievement, individual-to-group transfer and group creativity. In the first half of the \{CCM\} session, eye movement behavior across the three maps was interpreted as reflecting initial externalization and divergent processes through which learners mutually compare their knowledge and engage in a process of modeling each other. The second half of the \{CCM\} session was identified as a convergent phase characterized by a decrease in eye movement transitions between maps, and a convergence of attention on the collaborative map. The results also showed that in the first half of the collaboration, learners of the \{DK\} condition transitioned more between their own and partner maps, and therefore had more difficulty coordinating their respective prior knowledge compared to learners of the \{SK\} condition. Participants with different/unshared prior knowledge also focused their attention mainly in their own map and explored less their partner map in the first half of the collaboration. This suggests that they worked in a less collaborative way compared to those with same/shared prior knowledge during the divergent phase. "

abstract = "The authors address the role of computer support for building conceptual self-awareness—that is, enabling students to think outside of concept boundaries in hope of enhancing creative potential. Based on meta-cognition theory, we developed an integrated concept mapping system (ICMSys) to improve users’ conceptual self-awareness in addition to applying concept mapping techniques in traditional learning scenarios. Since the \{ICMSys\} accommodates different perspectives, selected ideas made by peers are retained with the help of integrated concept map (ICMap) representations used as stimuli for reflective thinking. Results from a case study with 32 information management undergraduates indicate: (a) increased levels of conceptual self-awareness, (b) evidence of conceptual improvement in the students’ redrawn concept maps, (c) that \{ICMap\} viewing frequency exerted a positive impact on level of conceptual self-awareness, and (d) a significant correlation between level of conceptual self-awareness in redrawn personal concept maps and actual conceptual changes as determined by three experts. We describe student perceptions of the \{ICMSys\} in terms of comprehension practicality and conceptual self-awareness, and give suggestions for future research. "

In this paper, an automatic concept map construction technique, Fuzzy Association Concept Mapping (FACM), is proposed for the conversion of abstracted short texts into concept maps. The approach consists of a linguistic module and a recommendation module. The linguistic module is a text mining method that does not require the use to have any prior knowledge about using \{NLP\} techniques. It incorporates rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case based reasoning (CBR) for anaphoric resolution. It aims at extracting the propositions in text so as to construct a concept map automatically. The recommendation module is arrived at by adopting fuzzy set theories. It is an interactive process which provides suggestions of propositions for further human refinement of the automatically generated concept maps. The suggested propositions are relationships among the concepts which are not explicitly found in the paragraphs. This technique helps to stimulate individual reflection and generate new knowledge. Evaluation was carried out by using the Science Citation Index (SCI) abstract database and \{CNET\} News as test data, which are well known databases and the quality of the text is assured. Experimental results show that the automatically generated concept maps conform to the outputs generated manually by domain experts, since the degree of difference between them is proportionally small. The method provides users with the ability to convert scientific and short texts into a structured format which can be easily processed by computer. Moreover, it provides knowledge workers with extra time to re-think their written text and to view their knowledge from another angle. "

On the other hand, however, the effect of digital game-based learning in improving students' learning performance has been questioned. Several previous studies have reported that without properly integrating learning strategies into gaming scenarios, the effectiveness of educational computer games could be limited, or may be even worse than that of the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In this study, a concept map-embedded gaming approach is proposed for developing educational computer games by integrating concept mapping as part of the gaming scenarios to help students organize what they have learned during the game-based learning process. Moreover, a role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school natural science course based on the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the concept map-embedded gaming approach can significantly improve the students' learning achievement and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach revealed a significantly higher degree of perceived usefulness than those who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach.

Guidance on how to construct adequate knowledge structures can support meaningful learning. But lectures, for instance, often are structured in linear sequence by a number of slides and are thus biased towards linear representations of knowledge that are not appropriate for most scientific disciplines. In this study, a framework for concept maps was developed to complement lectures in human biology online. The course was aimed at student teachers at the undergraduate level. The work is based on recent theoretical research on the use of multimedia in learning environments and e-learning, knowledge structures perspectives of teaching and learning as well as theoretical assumptions of self-determination in educational processes. Each session (14 in total, e.g. human respiratory and circulatory system, physiology of senses, human anatomy) was supplemented by a digital concept map providing relevant concepts connected with linking words and continuative material attached via hyperlinks (e.g. images, web links, animations, video). Following each single lecture, students had free access to the concept maps to reinforce the latest topics and to prepare for the final examination. The objective of the study was to examine if the use of complementary concept maps (i) influences achievement and (ii) motivational variables. The students’ (N = 171) concept map use was logged along with a documentation of their achievement and miscellaneous variables regarding their motivation (e.g. interest/ enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/ importance, value/ usefulness). The logfile-data allowed distinguishing learners according to the frequency and duration of their concept map use. Additionally, computer-related self-efficacy was documented as a moderating factor. Results reveal the benefit of additional concept maps for achievement and positive motivational aspects, moderating factors are discussed. The emphasize of further research should be on students’ active engagement in structuring their individual learning by constructing adequate concept maps themselves, especially in science education courses.

The \{CMKMS\} should be useful in assessing the extent of a student's knowledge and in revealing their unique thought processes. The study was concerned not only with a student's self-evaluation of learning but also with their level of satisfaction after using the CMKMS. The \{CMKMS\} combines the diagnosis of concept mapping with the style of thought processing, and promotes teaching activities step-by-step, in order to promote effective student learning. In analyzing the factors that influence the effect of teaching, the teacher can determine a student's knowledge structure and highlight misconceptions by inspecting the concept maps and logs. The results of this study show that knowledge management involved in computer-aided instruction in the teaching of biology had a positive influence on learning effectiveness. The \{CMKMS\} also was useful in promoting the student's thought processing, creativity, and ability to judge. "

We describe the planning that each group underwent, how they approached the web development task, and their reactions to the experience afterwards. The overall pattern of results suggests that while the participants who planned using scenarios felt they better understood the web development task, it was the group who created concept maps that explored and incorporated more of the novel programming features of the \{CLICK\} tool. We also discuss the role of gender in the \{CLICK\} development task, noting that women were less likely to explore the tool's novel features and perceived themselves as less successful in the task.

While such studies used pre-made individual concept maps as awareness tools, empirical studies that used individual concept maps created by the group members themselves have not shown an advantage for group performance. An assumed reason is that individual members’ concept maps differ too much structurally so that using them would need a lot of effort. This experimental study compares 20 triads whose members can observe the map creation process of the other members in their group with 20 triads without this possibility. The results demonstrated that access to the map creation process of the other group members while building one’s own concept map led to a group norm of how to create such a map. As a result, group members created more structurally similar maps, which led, as in prior studies with pre-made maps, to improved group performance. "

Concept maps have an abstract structure as typed hypergraphs, and computer support for concept mapping can associate visual attributes with node types to provide an attractive and consistent appearance. Computer support can also provide interactive interfaces allowing arbitrary actions to be associated with nodes such as hypermedia links to other maps and documents. This article describes a general concept mapping system that is open architecture for integration with other systems, scriptable to support arbitrary interactions and computations, and cutomizable to emulate many styles of map. The system supports collaborative development of concept maps across local area and wide area networks, and integrates with World-Wide Web in both client helper and server gateway roles. A number of applications are illustrated ranging through education, artificial intelligence, active documents, hypermedia indexing and concurrent engineering. It is proposed that concept maps be regarded as basic components of any hypermedia system, complementing text and images with formal and semi-formal active diagrams. "

By examining a group of 66 students engaged in learning to construct good concept maps with computer software, this study revealed several important findings on these questions. Students generally tended to initially overestimate their ability to successfully carry out the required task. They also varied in the way their general self-efficacy and performance were associated with their task-specific self-efficacy and performance. And, these differences did appear to be associated with different learning outcomes and motivations for learning. These results indicate that investigating individual differences in students’ patterns of association between general and specific performance and their self-efficacy may lead to a better understanding of how students differ in their levels of motivation and outcomes when learning a new and challenging task.

The ultimate goal was to discover how students understand the structure of an empowering discourse as a whole. Methods A one-group pretest–posttest design was adopted. The data were collected from graduating nursing students (n = 42) in six Finnish polytechnics, through concept maps created in connection to a computer simulation program during pre- and posttest phases. Results Results revealed that nursing students’ knowledge of an empowering discourse improved after using the computer simulation as a learning method, but the students still lacked holistic knowledge of an empowering discourse. Conclusion Based on this study, more attention should be paid to learning methods in nursing education so that students achieve a sufficient knowledge base to empower their patients. "

abstract = "Abstract To date, a look at the scientific literature on the construction and use of synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) support environments reveals that most researchers have focused either on exchanging information or on constructing and presenting posts. In this work, an intelligent collaborative synchronous \{CMC\} platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. The concept maps related to the learning topics are first outlined by the instructor. After each learner issues a post on the synchronous \{CMC\} platform, a feature selection approach is adopted to derive the input parameters of a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners’ posts are related to the concept maps previously outlined by the instructor. Meanwhile, learner peers from the same group are asked to provide comments on the synchronous CMCs, and a group grading module is established in this work to evaluate the quality of the synchronous CMCs. If the evaluation results from the classifier and the group grading module are inconsistent, the instructor or the teaching assistant is consulted to verify the evaluation results. Notably, a feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to learners in cases where the synchronous \{CMC\} support system detects that the learners have strayed astray from the expected learning topics in their posts. The classification rates for the one-class \{SVM\} classifier can reach up to 97.06%, and the average pre-test and post-test grades were 51.94 and 66.77, respectively, which revealed that the junior high school students participating in synchronous \{CMC\} activities related to natural science were benefited by the proposed intelligent synchronous \{CMC\} platform.

Students would benefit more if the test results could be analyzed and hence advice could be provided accordingly. This study proposes a conceptual map model, which provides learning suggestions by analyzing the subject materials and test results.

In particular, we consider the applicability of “concept maps” to inform the construction of educational materials, especially their topological, geometrical and pedagogical significance. We supplement this “spatial” dimension with a theory of the dynamic, temporal dimension, grounded in a context of learning processes, such as Kolb’s learning cycle. Finally, we address the multi-player aspects of computer games, and relate this to the theories of social and collaborative learning. This paper attempts to explore various theoretical bases, and so support the development of a new learning and teaching virtual reality approach. "

However, the data extraction process still relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process. Methods We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were evaluated in finding common clinical \{SR\} data elements such as sample size, group size, and \{PICO\} values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review’s study characteristics tables. Results At the sentence level, the computer-generated summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 91.2% vs. 83.8%, p \&lt; 0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences (precision 59% vs. 39%, p \&lt; 0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7% F-measure. Conclusion Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an extractive summarization system. "

In a pre-test administered in June 2000, students in three cohorts aged 10–11, 13–14 and 15–16, produced around 2000 ‘maps’. Entitled ‘Computers in My World’, these provide a means of students externalising mental representations of networked technologies. Using a phenomenographic approach, the study aims to identify qualitatively different patterns of thinking and trends in the development of pupils' concepts. Five quanititative measures emerged from heuristic analysis of the maps: nodes, links, connectivity, ‘Spheres of Thinking’ and ‘Zones of Use’. Analysis of the pre-test maps was carried out alongside analysis of pre-test questionnaires, using SPSS. The outcomes suggest correlations between pupils' experience and the constent of their maps. Phenomenographic interviewing of selected 11 year old pupils, which entailed handling control over to interviewees through the use of open-ended questions, enabled further exploration of their experiences and understandings of those experiences. A method for in-depth interviewing of young students is described. Data suggest that pupils have sophisticated ‘secondary artifacts’ or mental models of the nature of networked technologies and their role in today's world. This has implications for the way that \{ICT\} is used in schools and for its potential as a tool for students' learning. "

This paper outlines an approach to the initial stages of a workplace program development which integrates health promotion and disease management. The approach commences with systematic and genuine processes of obtaining information from key stakeholders with broad experience of these interventions. This information is constructed into a program framework in which practice-based and research-informed elements are both valued. We used this approach to develop a workplace education program to reduce the onset and impact of a common chronic disease – osteoarthritis. To gain information systematically at a national level, a structured concept mapping workshop with 47 participants from across Australia was undertaken. Participants were selected to maximise the whole-of-workplace perspective and included health education providers, academics, clinicians and policymakers. Participants generated statements in response to a seeding statement: Thinking as broadly as possible, what changes in education and support should occur in the workplace to help in the prevention and management of arthritis? Participants grouped the resulting statements into conceptually coherent groups and a computer program was used to generate a ‘cluster map’ along with a list of statements sorted according to cluster membership. In combination with research-based evidence, the concept map informed the development of a program logic model incorporating the program's guiding principles, possible service providers, services, training modes, program elements and the causal processes by which participants might benefit. The program logic model components were further validated through research findings from diverse fields, including health education, coaching, organisational learning, workplace interventions, workforce development and osteoarthritis disability prevention. In summary, wide and genuine consultation, concept mapping, and evidence-based program logic development were integrated to develop a whole-of-system complex intervention in which potential effectiveness and assimilation into the workplace for which optimised.

In-class observations showed that the activity is performed two hours and it is effective to improve the students’ motivation and enables them to be active during the learning process. As a result, the laboratory activity can be used as an alternative to activities in the literature. To investigate this and other similar activities’ applicability in a comparative manner, further research should be undertaken. In addition, the effect of the laboratory activity based on 5E learning model combining different conceptual change methods should be examined if it helps the \{PSTs\} overcome their alternative conceptions and improve their SPS.

This study investigated the effectiveness and the use of tools in a CBLE. The impact of combined tools (concept maps and adjunct questions), tool-related characteristics (tool delivery mode: non-/embedded tool), tool advice (non-/explained tool functionality) and learner-related characteristics (prior knowledge, self-efficacy, goal orientation, perceptions and self-regulation) on the quantity and quality of tool use was analyzed. The effects of tool use on performance were also studied. One hundred and eighty-two participants were randomly assigned to one out of five conditions (embedded with and without explanation of tool functionality; non-embedded with and without explanation of tool functionality and a control condition). The results revealed that the tools were functional: Learners in the experimental groups did better in the performance test than the learners in the control group. Specifically, learners in the non-embedded conditions and with the explanation of the tool performed better than the control condition. Furthermore, learners in the embedded conditions spent significantly more time on both tools. The time spent on the tools decreased in learners with high performance avoidance levels (goal orientation) and tool usability perceptions, but increased in learners with high critical thinking (self-regulation skill). Consecutively, the time spent on the tools influenced performance positively. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for further research on tool use. "

Cluster analysis on the resulting communication characteristics resulted in four types of small student groups, including passive or reticent, frequently off-task, actively participating, and knowledge emphasizing. Most student groups (56%) were found to be relatively passive or reticent. Frequently off-task student groups made a protrusive amount of messages for off-task social purposes. The actively participating student groups were characterized by abundant discussion, particularly for continuing task, managing procedure and coordinating efforts. The distinctive feature of knowledge emphasizing student groups was that they devoted particular attention to task related knowledge. In addition, they performed better in task accomplishment. "

The design of the course, around a video game, is rooted in commonly accepted theories of how people learn. The article describes a study to assess the effectiveness of the video game-based course. Results show that students taking the game-based course, on average, spend roughly twice as much time, outside of class, on their course work. In a concept mapping exercise, students taking the game-based course demonstrate deeper learning compared to their counterparts taking traditional lecture/textbook-based numerical methods courses. "

These systems incorporate diverse features that allow students to enact and reveal their \{SRL\} strategies via the choices they make. However, research shows that students' use of such features is limited; students often neglect SRL-supportive tools in CBLEs. In this study, we examined middle school students' feature use and strategy development over time using a teachable agent system called Betty's Brain. Students learned about climate change and thermoregulation in two units spanning several weeks. Learning was assessed using a pretest–posttest design, and students' interactions with the system were logged. Results indicated that use of SRL-supportive tools was positively correlated with learning outcomes. However, promising strategy patterns weakened over time due to shallow strategy development, which also negatively impacted the efficacy of the system. Although students seemed to acquire one beneficial strategy, they did so at the cost of other beneficial strategies. Understanding this phenomenon may be a key avenue for future research on SRL-supportive CBLEs. We consider two hypotheses for explaining and perhaps reducing shallow strategy development: a student-centered hypothesis related to “gaming the system,” and a design-centered hypothesis regarding how students are scaffolded via the system.

According to our results, four major modeling actions (analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of modeling operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students’ conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed.

However, such unshared information could be task-relevant. Therefore, taking unshared information into consideration should be fostered. Second, Wegner’s theory of transactive memory system points out that groups perform better when the group members are informed about their collaborators’ knowledge. However, acquiring correct knowledge about what others know is difficult. An approach for solving these two problems is introduced which provides the group members with the collaborators’ meta-knowledge structures by means of digital concept maps. The study compares 20 triads with spatially distributed group members that had access to their collaborators’ meta-knowledge maps with 20 triads collaborating without these maps. Results showed, as expected, that the triads having been provided with such maps started sooner to discuss unshared information, applied more of their collaborators’ unshared information, and processed unshared information more deeply. Additional results, however, demonstrated in contrast to Wegner’s theory that being informed about the collaborators’ meta-knowledge is not sufficient to increase group performance. "

To analyse these electronic texts, evaluative criteria templates were developed from the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy, integrating levels of understanding with the distinctive characteristics of multimodal text production. Findings indicated not just the incremental acquisition of conceptual understanding equated with cognitive change but that the level of understanding might also be positively influenced by the students’ length of exposure to computer-mediated learning practices.

This was followed by a multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of the similarity ratings, and interpretation of the map. Initial results indicated that there was a confounding effect on the final map because of perceived semantic groupings based on surface characteristics which were not germane to the intended focus of the conceptualization exercise.

Networks in nature are an extremely common phenomenon and are among the most prolific sources of complexity in science. In computer science, networks have traditionally been regarded as physical or logical communication channels that connect processes together. The classical stuff of routing and switching networks, of RIP, OSPF, the \{OSI\} model and TCP/IP layers can be found in any number of books today. Network management nurses both the physical communication infrastructure and the logical patterns of work and data flows. Computer programs are themselves networks of interacting methods and components. Knowledge management itself is about connections that form networks between ideas and ontological primitives. Knowledge bases and conceptual mappings are desribed using a conceptual model for conceptual models by Strassner, i.e. Ontologies, and Vranken and Koymans describe how such mappings can be used as a universal-translator technology to integrate disparate user applications.

We discuss a technique for discovering and formalizing the implicit semantic relationships in two vocabularies: the International Classification of Disease Version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM), and SNOMED-Reference Terminology (SNOMED-RT). The results of this technique are used to augment the existing SNOMED-RT relation ontology [1], which is a necessary step in automated concept mapping between systems. The reference terminology must contain all the semantics implicit in the classification in order to map concepts between the two representations. We also provide an explicit representation of the implied semantics of ICD9-CM. This tabulation will be useful for other knowledge engineering efforts involving ICD9-CM. "

Current logical methods are based on a conceptualization formed from a language for formulas that can be structured as in abstracted trees or sets, and from semantics in terms of truth values formulated as tables or drawn as marks on trees and sets. This paper proposes a unifying description methodology based on the notion of flow progressing through a system of six stages. Truth values and formulas are visualized as “things that flow”, i.e., things that can be created, received, processed, released and transferred. Accordingly, a conceptual map can be drafted for the propagation of these flow things during the process of truth-value evaluation or the chain of formula constructions. The new methodology presents a viable contribution for building a deeper understanding of proofs. This aid to understanding is demonstrated in examples adapted from the resolution method "

The purpose of this paper is to describe a process evaluation model that was used to test a nutrition education \{CAI\} program for middle school students. The specific outcome that was measured was learning. Learning was assessed by changes in students’ cognitive structures of basic nutrition concepts included in the program. Concept maps were used to represent students’ cognitive structure and were constructed from data collected by semistructured interviews with children before and after they completed the program. Context was defined by students’ interaction with the computer and with other students. These data were collected by observation and analyzed by grounded theory methods.The value of the model is in the integration of measurements of change and context. Together, change and context provide a dynamic, continuous, and inductive evaluation of the learning process and the effectiveness of a nutrition education program. "

The study applied the Anderson's model of health service utilization, Venkatesh's theory of technology acceptance, and Chatman's and Wilson's information behavior theories. Methods This qualitative study is part of a larger study. An interpretive grounded theory approach was used to conduct in-depth interviews with Chinese caregivers of family members with dementia. The caregivers received Internet-based information support and personalized e-mail intervention. A purposive sample of fourteen caregivers was selected to participate in the interviews. Constant comparison, analytic memoing, case analysis, and concept mapping were used to conduct theoretical triangulation analysis. Results Three main factors influenced the use of the intervention: (a) caregiver needs, which are influenced by personal capacity, social support available, and caregiving belief; (b) information communication technology (ICT) factors, including accessibility barriers and perceived efforts to use the technology; and (c) style of using the technology, such as preference for using e-mail or the customized Website. The personal capacity of caregivers was influenced by many factors, including computer and language proficiency, health service knowledge, caregiving competence and competing roles and responsibilities. Social support available for caregivers included available computer, language or caregiving support and health service knowledge. Caregiving belief included traditional belief of giving care, and health belief of the illness. New caregivers needed a different kind of support intervention compared with experienced caregivers. Caregivers with different amounts of experience tended to have different learning styles, with new caregivers preferring interactive intervention and more experienced caregivers preferring more reflective learning. Conclusions This study reinforced the findings of the larger quantitative study that it is important to address both care-giving needs and technology factors in Internet-based intervention. The quantitative study found that less competent caregivers with more positive attitudes towards technology tended to use the intervention more frequently. In this qualitative research, the findings revealed that caregiver needs, \{ICT\} factors, and style of use explained the pattern of intervention use. This new conceptualization has integrated information acceptance, health service utilization, and information behavior theories. More studies will be needed to confirm if the proposed concept can explain or predict the usage behavior in other Web-based interventions. "

abstract = "The solution of complex, unstructured problems is faced with policy controversy and dispute, unused and misused knowledge, project delay and failure, and decline of public trust in governmental decisions. Mental model mapping (also called concept mapping) is a technique to analyse these difficulties on a fundamental cognitive level, which can reveal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, knowledge and subjective beliefs of stakeholders, experts and other actors, and can stimulate communication and learning. This article presents the theoretical framework from which the use of mental model mapping techniques to analyse this type of problems emerges as a promising technique. The framework consists of the problem solving or policy design cycle, the knowledge production or modelling cycle, and the (computer) model as interface between the cycles. Literature attributes difficulties in the decision-making process to communication gaps between decision makers, stakeholders and scientists, and to the construction of knowledge within different paradigm groups that leads to different interpretation of the problem situation. Analysis of the decision-making process literature indicates that choices, which are made in all steps of the problem solving cycle, are based on an individual decision maker’s frame of perception. This frame, in turn, depends on the mental model residing in the mind of the individual. Thus we identify three levels of awareness on which the decision process can be analysed. This research focuses on the third level. Mental models can be elicited using mapping techniques. In this way, analysing an individual’s mental model can shed light on decision-making problems. The steps of the knowledge production cycle are, in the same manner, ultimately driven by the mental models of the scientist in a specific discipline. Remnants of this mental model can be found in the resulting computer model. The characteristics of unstructured problems (complexity, uncertainty and disagreement) can be positioned in the framework, as can the communities of knowledge construction and valuation involved in the solution of these problems (core science, applied science, and professional consultancy, and “post-normal” science). Mental model maps, this research hypothesises, are suitable to analyse the above aspects of the problem. This hypothesis is tested for the case of the Zwolle storm surch barrier. Analysis can aid integration between disciplines, participation of public stakeholders, and can stimulate learning processes. Mental model mapping is recommended to visualise the use of knowledge, to analyse difficulties in problem solving process, and to aid information transfer and communication. Mental model mapping help scientists to shape their new, post-normal responsibilities in a manner that complies with integrity when dealing with unstructured problems in complex, multifunctional systems.

abstract = "Context The promise of the electronic medical record (EMR)11The electronic medical record (EMR) is defined as a type of clinical information system, which is dedicated to collecting, storing, manipulating, and making available clinical information important to the delivery of patient care. The central focus of such systems is clinical data and not financial or billing information. Such systems may be limited in their scope to a single area of clinical information (e.g., laboratory data), or they may be comprehensive and cover virtually every facet of clinical information pertinent to patient care (e.g., computer-based patient record systems). An ideal EMR's usually encompasses (i) a longitudinal collection of electronic health information for and about person; (ii) electronic access to person- and population-level information by authorized users. lies in its ability to reduce the costs of health care delivery and improve the overall quality of care – a promise that is realized through major changes in workflows within the health care organization. Yet little systematic information exists about the workflow effects of EMRs. Moreover, some of the research to-date points to reduced satisfaction among physicians after implementation of the \{EMR\} and increased time, i.e., negative workflow effects. A better understanding of the impact of the \{EMR\} on workflows is, hence, vital to understanding what the technology really does offer that is new and unique. Objective (i) To empirically develop a physician centric conceptual model of the workflow effects of EMRs; (ii) To use the model to understand the antecedents to the physicians’ workflow expectation from the new EMR; (iii) To track physicians’ satisfaction overtime, 3 months and 20 months after implementation of the EMR; (iv) To explore the impact of technology learning curves on physicians’ reported satisfaction levels. Design The current research uses the mixed-method technique of concept mapping to empirically develop the conceptual model of an EMR's workflow effects. The model is then used within a controlled study to track physician expectations from a new \{EMR\} system as well as their assessments of the EMR's performance 3 months and 20 months after implementation. Setting The research tracks the actual implementation of a new \{EMR\} within the outpatient clinics of a large northeastern research hospital. Participants The pre-implementation survey netted 20 physician responses; post-implementation Time 1 survey netted 22 responses, and Time 2 survey netted 26 physician responses. Intervention The implementation of the actual \{EMR\} served as the intervention. Since the study was conducted within the same setting and tracked a homogenous group of respondents, the overall study design ensured against extraneous influences on the results. Main outcome measures Outcome measures were derived empirically from the conceptual model. They included 85 items that measured physician perceptions of the EMR's workflow effect on the following eight issues: (1) administration, (2) efficiency in patient processing, (3) basic clinical processes, (4) documentation of patient encounter, (5) economic challenges and reimbursement, (6) technical issues, (7) patient safety and care, and (8) communication and confidentiality. The items were used to track expectations prior to implementation and they served as retrospective measures of satisfaction with the \{EMR\} in post-implementation Time 1 and Time 2. Results The findings suggest that physicians conceptualize \{EMRs\} as an incremental extension of older computerized provider order entries (CPOEs) rather than as a new innovation. The \{EMRs\} major functional advantages are seen to be very similar to, if not the same as, those of CPOEs. Technology learning curves play a statistically significant though minor role in shaping physician perceptions. Conclusions The physicians’ expectations from the \{EMR\} are based on their prior beliefs rather than on a rational evaluation of the EMR's fit, functionality, or performance. Their decision regarding the usefulness of the \{EMR\} is made very early, within the first few months of use of the EMR. These early perceptions then remain stable and become the lens through which subsequent experience with the \{EMR\} is interpreted. The findings suggest a need for communication based interventions aimed at explaining the value, fit, and usefulness of \{EMRs\} to physicians early in the pre- and immediate post-EMR implementation stages.

abstract = "Assessing the students' metacognitive accuracy was not without some difficulties. Many of the students' responses included multiple ideas that seemed to target multiple levels of the taxonomy. This seemed to provide an incomplete picture of the students' cognitive activity when a single noun was chosen to represent these multiple ideas. Conversely, there were times that the responses were quite brief, and students applied multiple nouns as cognitive-level labels. For example, one student responded “What is the meaning of default as it is used in the computer context? The general understanding of default is ‘failure to do something’. How does this fit into what it means in computerese?” This student also labeled this response using three nouns that were at three cognitive levels — the levels of analysis, knowledge, and comprehension. The raters based their scores on the evidence provided in the response. However, with the student evidently feeling that multiple ideas were represented and failing to provide evidence of these ideas in the form of a more complete response, the discrepancy, again, seemed to result in an incomplete picture of the activity we were attempting to measure. Based on Bloom's explanation of the taxonomy, if a higher-order cognitive-level label was appropriate, it would imply the presence of the lower-order levels. We did not operate with this assumption. Again, the researchers scored the responses based on the evidence provided and their combined subjective experiences with these students. The researchers' experience of the readings became an asset by allowing specific insight into some of the responses. Again, there is the issue of importance of the type of structure chosen during the knowledge-format-selection exercise and the relationship to other variables (in this case, concept-map complexity). A relationship between the two variables at the same data collection points would be anticipated, but this was not evidenced. It took the predominant format selected to reveal any significant findings. This fact, especially when combined with the fact that 9 of the 12 students changed formats at least once, may indicate that the students were continually tuning and restructuring in cyclical-type phases as suggested by Rumelhart and Norman (1978). The fact that acquiring information and building new knowledge structures (i.e., learning) involves numerous changes is clearly evidenced by the lack of singularly unidirectional patterns in the data of this study. For example, there was no clear trend of progressing to any of the three knowledge formats; students seemed to be trying different formats based on whatever experiences they might have had, at that point in time, in order to make sense of the information. There was clearly not a uniform pattern of metacognitive progression for the students as a whole. Some increased, and some actually decreased. The rhythm and flow evident in cyclical-models of learning may be responsible for the mixed results which produced a lack of vertical progression to (a) higher levels of metacognitive accuracy and (b) less linear, structure-free models for representing structural relationships of information. It has been recognized that development of conceptual understanding more often follows a zigzag as opposed to a linear path (Prawat, 1993). The fluctuation evident in this study may be more indicative of cyclical phases of learning rather than clear hierarchical progressions from low to high levels of learning. "
