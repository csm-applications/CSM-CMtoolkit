 abstract ={This paper investigates the effect of different forms of concept maps as scaffolding techniques to support answering quizzes in an online learning environment. Concept maps which represent a course topic have being utilised as a scaffolding technique for learning the subject matters and problem solving. However, due to the typical amount of information presented in the topic concept maps, learners might feel overwhelmed, reducing their motivation and increasing the learners' disorientation. In order to overcome this issue, a study was conducted with 59 undergraduates of a Software Engineering course to measure the effect of different forms of concept maps on learning. The study obtained statistically significant results when using concept maps adapted to given quizzes (known as task-adapted concept maps). Students' reflections collected through a questionnaire were very positive towards task-adapted concept maps as a scaffolding technique.}

Our results not only support the idea of concept mapping as a teaching tool, they also suggest that students gain the most when they are directly involved in creating the concept map. A long term objective of this research project is to create a generic Learning-by-Teaching Environment (LTE) that can function in a variety of domains including general Computer Science. Our experience also suggests that a sophisticated and adaptive LTE could be successful in helping college students acquire a deeper understanding of course material and a better clarification of any prior topic-based misconceptions.}

In this paper, we describe the process of incorporating a representation for conditional reasoning into Betty, a computer agent students teach via concept maps. Betty helps students formalize their knowledge of a domain by acting as a novice learner. Students use Betty to construct and assess their knowledge of science topics.We tested several prototypes combining conditional logic with concept maps and found that people had difficulty keeping conditional states and conceptual nodes separate. In the end, the "Unless Switch" provided the closest semantic parallel to the type of reasoning we wanted students to learn and generated the least amount of confusion.}

The benefits of this approach are primarily in the ease of use, flexibility in making necessary modifications and intuitive acceptance of such maps by clinicians. At the same time concept maps have sufficient formalism to allow conversion to state diagrams, activity charts and sequence diagrams which are required during model development and during software implementation.}

Previous work for the most part had considered these two sub-problems independently. We propose a framework that jointly optimizes these sub-problems and investigates methods that identify concept relationships. Experiments on concept maps that are manually extracted in six educational areas (computer networks, macroeconomics, precalculus, databases, physics, and geometry) show that our model outperforms supervised learning baselines that solve the two sub-problems separately. Moreover, we observe that incorporating textbook information helps with concept map extraction.}

We have investigated the effects of input configuration and mode of input on human to human computer interaction through the use of gesture based controllers. Application of Bales' Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) [1] supports identity trade offs in choosing from a plethora of available input devices and displays when investigating interaction and knowledge discovery.

Increasingly, Higher Educational departments are encouraged to plan and deploy technologies that facilitate interaction as a fundamental principle of moving into the Interaction Age, specifically 'new tools are needed to support informal learning activities, in particular processes associated with conceptual development' [2]. This need for new tools resulted in the creation of WiiDraw; software through which single or multiple users could interact with and manipulate conceptual mapping diagrams using gestural interaction concurrently. Gaming interfaces like the Nintendo Wii provide options for creating gesture-based input beyond the move-click capability of a mouse, offering new modes to groups who interact with and create conceptual knowledge with large screens.

Other example systems have used mouse input [3] and laser pointers [4] as a means through which to explore large-screen based systems, yet none of these have emerged as a clear choice for a range of applications, and there may not be a single best fit option. However, we now present a study of eleven groups who completed a conceptual mapping task on a shared wall-display to determine how the configuration and mode of input influenced the amount of interaction. The experiment consisted of a single between-groups factor of input configuration of two levels (one controller and two controllers) and a single within-groups factor of interaction style, consisting of two levels (controller with no gestures enabled and controller with gestures enabled). IPA was applied to the data that was obtained from video recordings made of each experiment. ANOVA indicated a main effect of number of controllers, F(1,18)=6.38, p=0.02, with a higher number of interactions when dyads had one controller (M=432, SD=93) than two controllers (M=310, SD=140). A main effect of gestures was evident, F(1,18)=5.08, p=0.04 with more interactions occurring with gestures (M=420, SD=119), than without (M=310, SD=129) (see Figure 1). The interaction effect was not statistically significant.

Results indicate that one controller afforded higher levels of human to human interaction, with gestures also increasing the number of interactions seen. Further analysis describes the differences in type of interaction and its impact upon knowledge discovery. However it appears Wii interact more when gesturing with concepts.}

This article connects the design elements of the GetSmart system to targeted concept-map-based learning processes, describes our system and research testbed, and analyzes our system usage logs. Results suggest that students did in fact use the tools in an integrated fashion, combining knowledge representation and search activities. After concept mapping was included in the curriculum, we observed improvement in students' online quiz scores. Further, we observed that students in groups collaboratively constructed concept maps with multiple group members viewing and updating map details.}

It is also used for the knowledge management as an aid to personalize the learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Concept Mapping provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. Concept Maps are relevant since they can be retrieved or adapted to new problems. In the other hand, Case-Based Reasoning as a technique in Artificial Intelligence plays an important role in knowledge retrieval and reuse of memories. In this paper the authors present a new approach to elaborate Intelligent Teaching/Learning Systems, where the techniques of Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using the Case-Based Reasoning as theoretical framework for the Student Model.

We applied these guidelines to the design of Pocket PiCoMap, a learner-centered concept mapping tool for handheld Pocket PCs. As part of a 9-month classroom study, students used both the handheld Pocket PiCoMap and a comparable desktop concept mapping tool called PiViT. The goal of this comparison between handheld and desktop tools was to better understand how the different form factors of these computers impact students' work processes and products. Our results suggest that students can successfully complete complex learning activities using handheld tools, and that specialized supports (called scaffolds) can be used to help students create better concept maps. This study also identifies several areas where handheld learning tools need further improvements, such as helping students organize their work within the confines of small handheld screens, and we discuss ways in which scaffolds might be used to improve future handheld learning tools.}

 abstract = {The search for truthful health information through Internet is an increasingly complex process due to the growing amount of resources. Access to information can be difficult to control even in environments where the goal pursued is well-defined, as in the case of learning activities with medical students. In this paper, we present a computer tool devised to ease the process of understanding medical concepts from information in clinical case histories. To this end, it automatically constructs concept maps and presents reliable information from different ontologies and knowledge bases. The two main components of the system are an Intelligent Information Access interface and a Concept Map Graph that retrieves medical concepts from a text input, and provides rich information and semantically related concepts. The paper includes a user evaluation of the first component and a systematic assessment for the second component. Results show that our proposal can be efficient and useful for students in a medical learning environment.}

The CmapTool data were drawn from a b-learning environment related to a Master's course offered by a Higher Education Institution, involving 20 Master's students. Experimental results have shown that the use of the proposed FISCMAP scheme for the evaluation of user's Quality of Concept Map (QoCM), by considering constructive CM variables (metrics), can increase the accuracy and validity of the intelligent system under consideration.}

We intend OCTAL to be a formative assessment tool that is not tied to any specific course by providing language-agnostic questions on computer science concepts. While the tool will be generalizable for many courses, our first prototype includes a concept map and question set for UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course, CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing.

These associations can be combined to form a fuzzy (i.e., gradual) semantic net representing a map of the knowledge in the Web.

Our future success depends upon the problem-solving and thinking abilities of professionals entering the Information Technology field. These professionals will be faced with many problems that are complex, Ill-defined, and multi-disciplinary in nature. But how do we, as educators, prepare these professionals to be successful? Are traditional approaches sufficient for the complexity they will face? This study examines ways of increasing learners' expertise of ill-defined concepts through the use of varying types of representations. Through a quasi-experimental research methodology, students were assigned into one of three groups and given multiple representations of an ill-defined concept "threat analysis". After each treatment, students created concept maps of their understanding of threat analysis, which was then scored against an expert concept map. Results show that multiple representations did increase conceptual understanding of an ill-defined concept from the first treatment to the second with diminishing returns thereafter. The varying contexts of the representations was not a factor, however the use of different instructional strategies did show a difference over the three treatments. Future research in examining how the structuredness of the representations presented to the learner increases conceptual understanding of ill-defined concepts will be of benefit to the field.}

The scope of the study is especially limited to the information & computation technologies which have been listed in the National R&D Plan. There are three main sub-plans in the National R&D Plan; Green Growth, New Growth Engine, and Science & Technology Basic Plan. To analyze the concept of converging technologies, this study selected the core converging technologies from each area to analyze the concept of converging technologies.

Then, their stem technologies are analyzed and presented in a concept map to show how the core converging technologies are created from them. Also, the core technologies are presented on the concept map to distinguish the converging types based on them.

This study aims to empirically present the concept of converging technology and to make clearly each converging types based on their core converging technologies.}

Our previous studies have shown that students gain better understanding of domain knowledge when they prepare to teach others versus when they prepare to take an exam. This finding has motivated us to develop computer agents that students teach using concept map representations with a visual interface. Betty is intelligent not because she learns on her own, but because she can apply qualitative-reasoning techniques to answer questions that are directly related to what she has been taught through the concept map. We evaluate the agents interfaces in terms of how well they support learning activities, using examples of their use by fifth grade students in an extensive study that we performed in a Nashville public school. A critical analysis of the outcome of our studies has led us to propose the next generation interfaces in a multi-agent paradigm that should be more effective in promoting constructivist learning and self-regulation in the learning by teaching framework}

Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in a non-programming manner. In this work, we examine the use of the peer review process in early, object-oriented, computer science courses as a way to develop the reviewers' knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation.

To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in two CS2 classes at local universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding exercises), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs. Overall, peer reviews are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented programming concepts.}

Emerging curricular now require educators to incorporate computational thinking and abstraction into their teaching. Many refer to Piaget's work as evidence of an age-related ceiling preventing younger pupils from being able to abstract. However, more recent evidence suggests that pupils use elements of abstraction in their general process of learning, and that the skill of abstraction can be explicitly taught. We draw on personal classroom experience to illustrate the points made in the literature. Common classroom activities such as using labelled diagrams, concept maps and storyboards are aligned to features of abstraction. We argue that abstraction can and should be taught to young pupils.}

Previous results showed that the awareness tool positively affected learning gain by enhancing the production of elaborative talk and knowledge negotiation. In the present paper, we describe the actual use of a knowledge awareness tool during the course of interaction by analyzing the gaze paths recorded during the experiment and how they relate to learning performance and verbal interactions. The results showed that learners refer to the knowledge awareness tool episodically during the course of collaboration, mainly to assess the epistemic value of the information provided by the peer, especially when the peer seems uncertain about his understanding. The potential of the synchronized eye-tracking method for research in computer supported collaborative learning is discussed.}

Electronic publication and conferencing is becoming common in all disciplines using commonly available Internet facilities such as ftp archives, list servers, gopher and world-wide web. Some scholarly communities that had not previously achieved a critical mass have done so through the net, others have launched major collaborative projects managed through the net, and others are questioning the value of conventional conferences that are limited by being localized in space and time compared with the flexibility of continuous international electronic conferencing through the web. However, the majority of current electronic scholarly discourse emulates paper-based media in relying primarily on text and diagrams for knowledge communication. It is beginning to take advantage of some of the multimedia capabilities of electronic publishing for color diagrams, pictures, movies and sound. Hypertext and hypermedia capabilities are being used to develop webs of linked material. Concept maps and formal knowledge structures are being used to provide a framework for knowledge expression, interchange and collaborative development. This article focuses on the extension of current documentation technologies to provide knowledge-level support for scholarly communities.}

This paper draws upon research in computer supported collaborative learning to establish a set of principles for the design of a tabletop learning system. We then show how these have been used to design our Collaid (Collaborative Learning Aid) environment. Key features of this system are: capture of multi-modal data about collaboration in a tabletop activity using a microphone array and a depth sensor; integration of these data with other parts of the learning system; transforming the data into visualisations depicting the processes that occurred during the collaboration at the table; and sequence mining of the interaction logs. The main contributions of this paper are: our design guidelines to build the Collaid environment and the demonstration of its use in a collaborative concept mapping learning tool applying data mining and visualisations of collaboration.}

 abstract = {Multimedia-based ontology construction and reasoning have recently been recognized as two important issues in video search, particularly for bridging semantic gap. The lack of coincidence between low-level features and user expectation makes concept-based ontology reasoning an attractive mid-level framework for interpreting high-level semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel model, namely ontology-enriched semantic space (OSS), to provide a computable platform for modeling and reasoning concepts in a linear space. OSS enlightens the possibility of answering conceptual questions such as a high coverage of semantic space with minimal set of concepts, and the set of concepts to be developed for video search. More importantly, the query-to-concept mapping can be more reasonably conducted by guaranteeing the uniform and consistent comparison of concept scores for video search. We explore OSS for several tasks including concept-based video search, word sense disambiguation and multi-modality fusion. Our empirical findings show that OSS is a feasible solution to timely issues such as the measurement of concept combination and query-concept dependent fusion.}

 abstract = {Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) researchers have successfully developed a range of agent programming languages that bridge the gap between theory and practice. Unfortunately, despite the in-community success of these languages, they have proven less compelling to the wider software engineering community. One of the main problems facing AOP language developers is the need to bridge the cognitive gap that exists between the concepts underpinning mainstream languages and those underpinning AOP. In this paper, we attempt to build such a bridge through a conceptual mapping between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the AgentSpeak(L) family of AOP languages. This mapping explores how OOP concepts and the concurrent programming concept of threads relate to AgentSpeak(L) concepts. We then use our analysis of this mapping to drive the design of a new programming language entitled ASTRA.}

 abstract = {Discovering mappings between concept hierarchies is widely regarded as one of the hardest and most urgent problems facing the Semantic Web. The problem is even harder in domains where concepts are inherently vague and ill-defined, and cannot be given a crisp definition. A notion of approximate concept mapping is required in such domains, but until now, no such notion is vailable.

The first contribution of this paper is a definition for approximate mappings between concepts. Roughly, a mapping between two concepts is decomposed into a number of submappings, and a sloppiness value determines the fraction of these submappings that can be ignored when establishing the mapping.

A potential problem of such a definition is that with an increasing sloppiness value, it will gradually allow mappings between any two arbitrary concepts. To improve on this trivial behaviour, we need to design a heuristic weighting which minimises the sloppiness required to conclude desirable matches, but at the same time maximises the sloppiness required to conclude undesirable matches. The second contribution of this paper is to show that a Google based similarity measure has exactly these desirable properties.

We establish these results by experimental validation in the domain of musical genres. We show that this domain does suffer from ill-defined concepts. We take two real-life genre hierarchies from the Web, we compute approximate mappings between them at varying levels of sloppiness, and we validate our results against a handcrafted Gold Standard.

Our method makes use of the huge amount of knowledge that is implicit in the current Web, and exploits this knowledge as a heuristic for establishing approximate mappings between ill-defined concepts.}

 abstract = {Software engineers usually approach complex problems by separating them into sub-problems. In multiagent systems, sub-problems are solved by autonomous agents that build organizational structures. Each agent internally further decomposes a problem by goal and plan hierarchies. The underlying design of a system rejects an engineers experience with approaching complex problems. It is desirable to reuse patterns and structures that proved their practical use and were validated (e.g. interaction protocols, goal hierarchies, behavior templates, organizational structures, etc.). This improves software quality and reduces development time and costs in the long run. Model-driven software engineering enables the separation of the platform independent design of the system under consideration and the actual implementation for a concrete execution platform. The gap between the different levels of abstraction is closed by model transformations. In this paper we propose a model-driven reverse engineering approach for lifting the underlying design of implemented multiagent systems to a platform independent level. For this purpose we specify conceptual mappings from the platform to our platform independent modeling language. The extracted structures have to be refined (e.g. by using existing platform independent artifacts) and can be re-used as blue print for solving similar problems on similar execution platforms. We evaluated our approach for the BDI agent platform Jadex and a real-world scenario.}

Unlike many traditional approaches that assume Normal performance distributions, the proposed approach is especially developed to handle multiple correlated non-Normal performance distributions, thereby providing better accuracy than other traditional techniques. Starting from a set of quadratic performance models, the proposed parametric yield extraction conceptually maps multiple correlated performance constraints to a single auxiliary constraint using a MAX(·) operator. As such, the parametric yield is uniquely determined by the probability distribution of the auxiliary constraint and, therefore, can be easily computed. In addition, a novel second-order statistical Taylor expansion is proposed for an analytical MAX(·) approximation, facilitating fast yield estimation. Our numerical examples in a commercial BiCMOS process demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides 2--3x error reduction compared with a Normal-distribution-based method, while achieving orders of magnitude more efficiency than the Monte Carlo analysis with 104 samples.}

Through a co-design study with scientists we identified specific aspects of conceptual maps they wish to create for their projects in order to make sense of diverse collections of digital media related to their individual and collective work. By the use of a technology probe called DeskPiles we observed the mechanisms involved in such a process. We identified the practice of using sub-document elements to compose the views of digital collections and diverse linking strategies to express semantic relations among concepts and ideas and to enable access to supporting digital assets. Our findings reveal the need to expand traditional information architectures and include (1) an extended range of content reference options and (2) transformation services to enable extraction, conversion, and linking of digital content. We advocate a granular and multi-format representation of content as the basis for reuse and ubiquitous access of digital media in diverse multi-device environments.}

 abstract = {To illustrate the "remarkable extent to which complexity theory operates by means of analogs from computability theory," Richard Karp created this conceptual map or jigsaw puzzle. To lay out the puzzle in the plane, he used a "graph planarity algorithm." The more distantly placed parts might not at first seem related, "but in the end, the theory of NP-completeness does bring them all together," Karp says. The upper right portion of the puzzle shows concepts related to combinatorial explosions and the notion of a "good" or "efficient" algorithm. In turn, "Complexity" connects these concepts to the upper left portion, which represents the concerns of early computability theorists. The traveling salesman problem is closer to the upper right corner because it is probably intractable. It therefore borders on "NP-completeness" and "Combinatorial explosion." To some extent, however, certain divisions blur. "Linear programming," for example, has an anomalous status—the most widely used algorithms for solving such problems in practice are not good in the theoretical sense, and those that are good in the theoretical sense are often not good in practice. One example is the ellipsoid method that was the object of so much attention six years ago. It ran in polynomial time, but the polynomial was of such a high degree that the method proved good in the technical sense, but ineffective in practice. "The reason is that our notion of polynomial-time algorithms doesn't exactly capture the notion of an intuitively efficient algorithm," Karp explains. "When you get up to n5 or n6, then it's hard to justify saying that it is really efficient. So Edmonds's concept of a good algorithm isn't quite a perfect formal counterpart of good in the intuitive sense." Further, the simplex algorithm is good in every practical sense, Karp says, but not good according to the standard paradigm of complexity theory. The most recent addition to linear programming solutions, an algorithm devised by Narendra Karmarkar that some think challenges the simplex algorithm, is good in the technical sense and also appears to be quite effective in practice, says Karp. The good algorithm segment is adjacent to "Heuristics" because a heuristic algorithm may work well, but lack a theoretical pedigree. Some heuristic algorithms are always fast, but sometimes fail to give good solutions. Others always give an optimal solution, but are not guaranteed to be fast. The simplex algorithm is of the latter type. "Undecidability, " "Combinatorial explosion," and "Complexity" are on the same plane because they are analogs of one another; undecidability involves unbounded search, whereas combinatorial explosions are by definition very long but not unbounded searches. Complexity theory bridges the gap because, instead of asking whether a problem can be solved at all, it poses questions about the resources needed to solve a problem. The lower left region contains the segments Karp has been concerned with most recently and that contain open-ended questions. "Randomized algorithm," for example, is situated opposite "Probabilistic analysis" because both are alternatives to worst-case analyses of deterministic algorithms. Randomized algorithms might be able to solve problems in polynomial time that deterministic ones cannot and that could mean an extension of the notion of good algorithms. Perhaps through software designs for non-von Neumann machines, algorithms can be made more efficient in practice through parallelism. Finally, some parts of the puzzle are not yet defined. Says Karp, "They correspond to the unknown territory that remains to be explored in the future."}
