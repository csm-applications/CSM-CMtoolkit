<title>A variable strength interaction test suites generation strategy using Particle Swarm Optimization</title> 

This paper highlights a novel strategy for generating variable-strength (VS) interaction test suites, called VS Particle Swarm Test Generator (VS-PSTG). As the name suggests, VS-PSTG adopts Particle Swarm Optimization to ensure optimal test size reduction. To determine its efficiency in terms of the size of the generated test suite, VS-PSTG was subjected to well-known benchmark configurations.
