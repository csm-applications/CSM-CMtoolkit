<title>An analysis of research topics in software engineering</title>

This paper is the first in a new annual series whose goal is to answer the following question: what are the active research focuses within the field of software engineering? We considered 7 top journals and 7 top international conferences in software engineering and examined all the 691 papers published in these journals or presented at these conferences in 2006.
