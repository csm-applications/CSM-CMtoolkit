<title>Generating semantically valid test inputs using constrained input grammars</title>

<context>
Generating test cases based on software input interface is a black-box testing technique that can be made more effective by using structured input models such as input grammars. Automatically generating grammar-based test inputs may lead to structurally valid but semantically invalid inputs that may be rejected in early semantic error checking phases of a system under test.</context>
Objective
This paper aims to introduce a method for specifying a grammar-based input model with the modelâ€™s semantic constraints to be used in the generation of positive test inputs. It is also important that the method can generate effective test suites based on appropriate grammar-based coverage criteria.
Method
Formal specification of both input structure and input semantics provides the opportunity to use model instantiation techniques to create model instances that satisfy all specified constraints. The input interface of a subject system can be specified using a high-level specification scheme such as attribute grammars, and a transformation function from this scheme to an instantiable formal modeling language can generate the desired model instances.
