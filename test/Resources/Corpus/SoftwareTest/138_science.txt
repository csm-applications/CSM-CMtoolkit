<title>A data flow-based structural testing technique for FBD programs</title>

With increased use of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in implementing critical systems, quality assurance became an important issue. Regulation requires structural testing be performed for safety-critical systems by identifying coverage criteria to be satisfied and accomplishment measured. Classical coverage criteria, based on control flow graphs, are inadequate when applied to a data flow language function block diagram (FBD) which is a PLC programming language widely used in industry. We propose three structural coverage criteria for FBD programs, analyze relationship among them, and demonstrate their effectiveness using a real-world reactor protection system.
