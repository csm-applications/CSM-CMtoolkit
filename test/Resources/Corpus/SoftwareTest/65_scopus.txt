<title>Understanding the influence of social media in the workplace: An integration of media synchronicity and social capital theories</title>

Social media has deeply penetrated workplace, which has affected multiple aspects of employees' lives. This paper aims to investigate the influence of social media on employees' work performance and the underlying mechanism for how they create value at work. Based on media synchronicity and social capital theories, we propose that social media can promote work performance by stimulating trust among employees and offering a communication channel where explicit and implicit knowledge can be effectively transferred. The research model is tested using data collected from 105 Chinese software professionals.
