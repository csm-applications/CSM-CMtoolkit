<title>Impact of Experience and Team Size on the Quality of Scenarios for Architecture Evaluation</title>


Software and systems architecture is a success-critical issue in software projects. Changing nonfunctional quality requirements, e.g., performance, modifiability, and maintainability, can have strong impact on software architecture and can result in a high rework effort in case of changes. Architecture reviews help evaluating architectural design with scenarios in early stages of product development. Quality-sensitive scenarios represent a set of software requirements (including non-functional quality attributes). In this paper we empirically investigate the impact of potentially important factors on the number and quality of scenarios elicited in an architecture evaluation workshop: (a) scoring schemes for scenario quality, (b) workshop participant experience, and (c) team size for workshop group work.
