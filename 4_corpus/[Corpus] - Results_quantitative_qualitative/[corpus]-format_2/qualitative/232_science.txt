Experimental results obtained on the Ncube7 hypercube are presented.
The near-linear speedups show the perfect match that exists between the software testing application and a local memory MIMD architecture typified by the Ncube7 machine.
The compilation bottleneck, which could have an adverse effect on the speedup, is illustrated by experimental results.
