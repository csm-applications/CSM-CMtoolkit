The conversion type most often used as well as the conversion type based on transaction function size were found to generate nonlinear, inaccurate and invalid results according to measurement theory.
In addition, they produce a loss of measurement information in the conversion process, because of the FPA weighting system and FPA structural problems, such as illegal scale transformation. 
Our proposed conversion type avoids the problems inherent in the other two types but not the nonlinearity problem.
