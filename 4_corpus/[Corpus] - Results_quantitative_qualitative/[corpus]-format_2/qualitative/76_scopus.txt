We built a formal model for the process of assigning human resources to software project teams. 
This model takes into account as many factors as possible and aids the assignment of individuals to project roles, as well as the formation of the team as a whole. 
We found that the rules that were identified to form software development project teams are useful.
From the tests we found that model implementation was feasible (all the executions of the implemented problem-solving algorithms output feasible solutions in response times that can be considered as acceptable).
