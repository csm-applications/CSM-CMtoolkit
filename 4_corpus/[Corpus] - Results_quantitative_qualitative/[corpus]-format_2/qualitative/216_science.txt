Our results show that (a) the proposed general framework abstracts all the common characteristics of online testing techniques proposed in the literature, 
(b) it can be exploited to design experiments aimed at performing objective comparisons among different online testing approaches and 
(c) some parameters that we have identified influence the performance of the testing techniques.
