Based on the data collected from two industrial software projects for four measures of size of requirements (number of actors, use cases, words, and lines), we have evaluated prediction models for requirements volatility. 
These models can help project managers to estimate the volatility of requirements and minimize the risks caused by volatile requirements, like schedule and cost overruns. 
In cross systems validation our best model showed a mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) of 0.25, which can be considered reliable.
