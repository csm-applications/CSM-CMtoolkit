We found that challenges faced when testing scientific software fall into two main categories: (a) testing challenges that occur due to characteristics of scientific software such as oracle problems and 
(b) testing challenges that occur due to cultural differences between scientists and the software engineering community such as viewing the code and the model that it implements as inseparable entities. 
In addition, we identified methods to potentially overcome these challenges and their limitations. 
Finally we describe unsolved challenges and how software engineering researchers and practitioners can help to overcome them.
