In this article we present the results of a large experiment in unit test generation using the EvoSuite tool on 100 randomly chosen open-source projects, the 10 most popular open-source projects according to the SourceForge Web site, seven industrial projects, and 11 automatically generated software projects.
The study confirms that EvoSuite can achieve good levels of branch coverage (on average, 71% per class) in practice.
