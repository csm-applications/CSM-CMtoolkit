2- Implementation using the Java language of the features described in the documentation.
3- Python implementation that will be used in future projects
4- The corpus used to train and test the proposed initiatives.

# Running the project

To run this project you must download the Java project. From this you can use each module separately only by solving the dependencies necessary for the project to work.

To download Stanford Parser dependencies, go to:
- https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml

The second option is to use the modules for construction of Conceptual Maps present in graphical interface. For this you must import the complete project and resolve the dependencies. Remember to update the paths to the corpus files.
