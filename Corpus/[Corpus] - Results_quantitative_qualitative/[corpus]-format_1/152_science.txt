<title>Testing robot controllers using constraint programming and continuous integration</title>

<context>
Testing complex industrial robots (CIRs) requires testing several interacting control systems. This is challenging, especially for robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing, since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled with the robot’s motion control.</context>
Objective
Current practices for validating CIRs involve manual test case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate CIR control systems in an industrial context.
Method
This paper reports on a methodology, developed at ABB Robotics in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of CIRs control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on a novel constraint-based model for automatically generating test sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part of a continuous integration process.

		In a real industrial setting, the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults.

Conclusion
Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for CIRs and can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context.
