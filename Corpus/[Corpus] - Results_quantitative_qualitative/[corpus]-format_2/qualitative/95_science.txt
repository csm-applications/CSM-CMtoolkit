The experimental results validated the hypothesis that the ISBST system generates test cases that are not found by the same participants employing manual testing techniques. 
A follow-up laboratory experiment also investigates the importance of interaction in obtaining the results.
In addition to this main result, the subjective workload was assessed for each participant by means of the NASA-TLX tool.
The evaluation showed that, while the ISBST system required more effort from the participants, they achieved the same performance.
