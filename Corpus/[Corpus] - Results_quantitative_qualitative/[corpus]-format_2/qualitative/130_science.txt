The first study highlights some practical problems with the decision procedure for pointer inputs described in this paper.
In particular, if the code under test contains insufficient guard statements to enforce constraints over pointers, then using a constraint solver for pointer inputs may be suboptimal compared to a method that generates random memory graphs. 
The programs used in the second study do not require any constraint solving for pointer inputs and consist of eight non-trivial, real-world C functions drawn from three embedded automotive software modules.
