The results show that a test suite not directly calling the refactored method and/or its callers increases the chance of missing the fault. 
Additional analysis of branch coverage on test cases shows that there are higher chances of detecting a refactoring fault when branch coverage is high. 
These results give evidence that a combination of impact analysis with branch coverage could be highly effective in detecting faults introduced by refactoring edits.
