The major findings of the study are: (a) that the individual techniques are of broadly similar effectiveness in terms of observing failures and finding faults, 
(b) that the relative effectiveness of the techniques depends on the nature of the program and its faults, 
(c) these techniques are consistently much more effective when used in combination with each other.
These results contribute to a growing body of empirical evidence that supports generally held beliefs about the effectiveness of defect detection techniques in software engineering.
