The results show meta-heuristic search techniques have been applied for the optimization of test data generation, mutant generation and selection of effective mutation operators. 
Five meta-heuristic techniques, namely Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony, Bacteriological Algorithm, Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing have been used in search based mutation testing. 
The review addressed different fitness functions used to guide the search.
