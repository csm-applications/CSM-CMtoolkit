Experiments with the prototype revealed a performance overhead of SPARQL queries when compared to MySQL database queries. 
It is proposed that further optimization for SPARQL queries is needed in order to improve the response time of working with triple store. 
Overall, the test outcomes demonstrated that the proposed solution supports the process of selecting software and has the potential of improving IT infrastructure management practices.
