** Understanding the concepts and relationship extraction

Extracting concepts and relationships is part of the larger project of building conceptual maps automatically.

The identification of concepts in a sentence can be done in several ways. For example, one of the simplest techniques is to identify the most frequent terms in the text. However, only the term count may not be sufficient to extract relevant concepts. In addition, one of the biggest challenges is the extraction of relationships.

Therefore, in this section we present several implementations of techniques for extracting concepts and relationships from a plain text. Also present here are the references to folder "corpus" used to test these approaches.
