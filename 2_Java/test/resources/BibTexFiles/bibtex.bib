abstract={Software testing is the process on how to identify and deliver the software as a product based on the specification that has been given and required by the users. In order to ensure that the product is working based on the user specification, there are many people who are working together for that purposes as a community of practice (CoP). The CoP in software testing environment is including the system designer, programmer, and system tester as well as the user by himself. Based on this scenario of working together or collaboratively in order to avoid a lot of mistake or errors and causes the software failure, which may be found during the processes of software testing process, so that there is a need for CoP to have a tool called knowledge management system (KMS) in managing the knowledge of best practice and lesson learnt. The paper will discuss the concept on how the KMS is offering of its processes through knowledge life cycle which starting from knowledge acquisition, knowledge storing, knowledge dissemination, and knowledge application. Therefore, by using the model of KMS in managing knowledge of software testing, CoP can utilize the knowledge in KMS and it will reduces the mistake or errors, so that they can delivered a good product besides to enhance the quality of software of the particular users.},

title={Antecedents of Coordination Effectiveness of Software Developer Dyads From Interacting Teams: An Empirical Investigation},
year={2009},
volume={56},
number={3},
pages={494-507},
abstract={Among the numerous reasons for software project failure, coordination problems are especially salient. Prior studies on coordination in software development are confined to team internal coordination and do not explicitly differentiate team internal and external coordination processes. This study presents a research model to explain the antecedents of coordination effectiveness of software developer dyads from interacting teams. Dyads in this study refer to software developer pairs where each member comes from a different team. We explore the antecedents by integrating interpersonal and technology-based coordination. We test this model using data collected from 59 software developer Dyads from interacting teams as well as from software developer leaders. The results reveal that the implicit knowledge sharing has a significant positive impact on coordination effectiveness. The use of explicit knowledge sharing and coordination technology have no statistically significant impact on coordination effectiveness although the teams studied were working predominantly in a collocated mode. Mutual trust and project commitment have a significant impact on knowledge sharing with mutual trust directly affecting both implicit and explicit knowledge sharing. Project commitment also has a direct impact on explicit knowledge sharing and mutual trust, but it does not directly affect implicit knowledge sharing. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed. Limitations of this study are identified. Future research directions are also presented.},

abstract={A mapping study provides a broad overview of a research area in order to determine whether there is research evidence on a particular topic. Results of a systematic mapping may identify suitable areas for performing future research. In this paper, we discuss our experience in using the findings of a mapping study on Knowledge Management (KM) in Software Testing for performing a real research project, which also applied other empirical approaches. The main goals of this paper are: (i) to reinforce the importance of a systematic mapping in the conduction of a research project by discussing a real case of such application, and (ii) to present the results of our survey on the most important aspects of KM when applied to software testing.},

abstract={Software testing is a major V\&V activity that revolves around quality test cases. Generating quality test cases is inherently knowledge intensive, tedious and expensive task that is traditionally done by humans. Therefore, a great deal of research has been done to facilitate and automate test case generation as much as possible. Given the knowledge intensity of software test case generation, various knowledge management techniques, such as semantic-based techniques, are applicable. The main focus of our research is automatic generation of quality test cases using available knowledge from the early stages of software development, i.e. the RE. Our goal is to develop a semantic web enabled framework for integrating knowledge from various requirement models to generate effective and efficient test cases automatically. We are going to apply semantic technology to facilitate the test case generation process by means of ontologies and Web of Data.},

abstract={In software testing organizations, effective knowledge management of the testing process is the key to improve the quality of software testing. One of the most important research questions is how to effectively integrate the knowledge management with the software testing process so that the knowledge assets can be spread and reused in software testing organizations. In this paper, the current state of knowledge management in software testing was analyzed and the major existing problems were identified; a knowledge management system in software testing was designed and implemented. In the mean time, many ontology-based key technologies have been proposed, which could be used in knowledge representation of software testing, search and sorting of the knowledge document, and construction of the knowledge map. Finally, an example of the knowledge map module was given to verify that knowledge management in software testing is reasonable and effective.},

abstract={Computer systems do not learn from previous experiences unless they are designed for this purpose. Computational intelligence systems (CIS) are inherently capable of dealing with imprecise contexts, creating a new solution in each new execution. Therefore, every execution of a CIS is valuable to be learned. We describe an architecture for designing CIS that includes a knowledge management (KM) framework, allowing the system to learn from its own experiences, and those learned in external contexts. This framework makes the system flexible and adaptable so it evolves, guaranteeing high levels of reliability when performing in a dynamic world. This KM framework is being incorporated into the computational intelligence tool for software testing at National Institute for Systems Test and Productivity. This paper introduces the framework describing the two underlying methodologies it uses, i.e. case-based reasoning and monitored distribution; it also details the motivation and requirements for incorporating the framework into CIS.},

abstract={Software testing is a critical process for achieving product quality. Its importance is more and more recognized, and there is a growing concern in improving the accomplishment of this process. In this context, Knowledge Management emerges as an important supporting tool. However, managing relevant knowledge to reuse is difficult and it requires some means to represent and to associate semantics to a large volume of test information. In order to address this problem, we have developed a Reference Ontology on Software Testing (ROost). ROost is built reusing ontology patterns from the Software Process Ontology Pattern Language (SP-OPL). In this paper, we discuss how ROost was developed, and present a fragment of Roost that concerns with software testing process, its activities, artifacts, and procedures.},

The popular process improvement models do not adequately address testing application issues, nor has the knowledge management (KM) implementation in testing been well defined. The plan-do-check-action (PDCA)-based testing improvement framework is proposed to address these issues. The framework contains the adaptive processes definition, the processes implementation and measurement analysis, and benchmarking-based assessment approach. Experiments show that: the framework can stimulate team member's subjective initiative, promote the software testing process and improve the testing service quality.},

abstract={In globally distributed software projects the testing expertise may be scattered across multiple locations. We describe and discuss a globally distributed agile project at DNV GL Software, a multinational provider of software for a safer, smarter and greener future in the energy, process and maritime industries. DNV GL Software is headquartered in Norway. The project is distributed across two locations with 12 team members in Norway and three testers in China. In a distributed agile team with little overlap in working hours the challenge is to coordinate tasks and test activities in a way that makes coordination and communication efficient. DNV GL Software believes in including the remote testers as part of the agile team, enabling self-managing, cross-functional virtual teams that are capable of taking the full responsibility for implementing and verifying one entire feature. To support the communication between testers in China and the rest of the team in Norway, the team needs a shared understanding of the goal of a release and how to collaborate. We conducted interviews with the team and representatives from different roles in the organization, and we performed retrospectives with the team. In this article we describe how continuous testing based on continuous and frequent feedback ensures knowledge sharing and safeguarding the quality of the system under development. We found the following enablers for a successful virtual agile team: coordination by mutual adjustment, dedicated testers and low turnover, shifting working hours, and self-management and autonomy. Non-technical factors, such as socio-technical and organizational factors, have a significant influence on the way software testing is performed in an agile virtual team. To be successful the organization needs to invest in bringing the remote testers closer to the rest of the team, as part of the virtual team.},

Our previous study results revealed that knowledge in the repositories were outdated, internal documents are unstructured and varied formats, less accessing facilities and lack of targeted delivery methods, such that software testers from software companies are highly affected by not being able to get vital information required to carryout their software testing activities. Ontologies emerge as one of the more appropriate knowledge management tools for supporting knowledge representation, processing, storage and retrieval. A Software testing ontology is designed to represent the necessary software testing knowledge within the software testers' context. The ontology-based Knowledge Sharing Portal is introduced into the semantic representation of software testing knowledge. SPARQL is used as the query language to retrieve software testing knowledge from the semantic storage. Both Ontology experts and non-experts evaluated the developed ontology.},

abstract={The objective of this qualitative study was to understand the complex practice of software testing, and based on this understanding, to develop hypotheses on testing organizations and knowledge management. The population of the study consisted of organizational units (OUs) that develop and test technical software for automation or telecommunication domains. First, a survey of testing practices was conducted and 26 OUs were interviewed. From this sample, five OUs were further selected for an in-depth case study. The study used grounded theory as its research method and the data was collected from 41 theme-based interviews. The analysis yielded hypotheses that included that the business orientation of an OU affects testing organization, knowledge management strategy, and outsourcing of testing. Further, identifying and avoiding barriers and using enablers improve knowledge transfer between development and testing. The results of this study can be used in developing the testing organization and the knowledge management strategy of an OU.},
