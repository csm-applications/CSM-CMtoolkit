<title>Anomaly detection in concurrent Java programs using dynamic data flow analysis</title>

Concurrency constructs are widely used when developing complex software such as real-time, networking and multithreaded clientâ€“server applications. Consequently, testing a program, which includes concurrency constructs is a very elaborate and complex process. In this work, we first identify the different classes of synchronization anomalies that may occur in concurrent Java programs.

		Moreover, we show how the data flow analysis technique can be extended to detect such anomalies.
