<title>A software cybernetics approach to self-tuning performance of on-line transaction processing systems </title>

Abstract Self-tuning performance of On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems is a challenging and time-consuming task since multiple performance parameters are needed to be automatically configured in Database Management Systems (DBMSs). In this paper, we present a software cybernetics approach to self-tune the performance of DBMSs. A \{DBMS\} is designed with an adaptive control based on fuzzy logic such that it has the capability to control objects, i.e., the performance parameters, and update the controller itself, i.e., a set of fuzzy rules in our case. The principles and concepts in software cybernetics are applied to guide the synthesis of software controllers for monitoring and adapting system behaviors.
