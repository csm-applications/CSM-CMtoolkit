<title>Software metrics as a programming training tool </title>

Software metrics have been recommended for quite some time as a tool to help manage the development and maintenance of computer software; however, little attention has been focused on using software metrics as a programmer training tool. Training on software complexity metrics was integrated into an advanced Cobol programming class, and a simple experiment was performed to determine if the training had any effect on program complexity, development time, and several dimensions of quality. This article describes
