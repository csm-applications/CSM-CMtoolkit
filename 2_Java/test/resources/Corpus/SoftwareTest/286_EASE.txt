<title>Patterns of Evolution in the Practice of Distributed Software Development: Quantitative Results from a Systematic Review</title>

Distributed Software Development is recent as a research area. With the evolution of its practice, more questions have emerged, and more research has been conducted. Consequently, this resulted in an increase in the existent literature. At the same time, the diversity of industry experience in the last ten years has been used to develop successful practices. We lack, however, knowledge of patterns of evolution in the practice of distributed software development that have been identified and proposed in the literature.
