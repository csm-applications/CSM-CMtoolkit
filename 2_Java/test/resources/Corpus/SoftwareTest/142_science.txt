<title>Goal-oriented dynamic test generation</title>

<context>
Memory safety errors such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities are one of the most serious classes of security threats. Detecting and removing such security errors are important tasks of software testing for improving the quality and reliability of software in practice.</context>
Objective
This paper presents a goal-oriented testing approach for effectively and efficiently exploring security vulnerability errors. A goal is a potential safety violation and the testing approach is to automatically generate test inputs to uncover the violation.
Method
We use type inference analysis to diagnose potential safety violations and dynamic symbolic execution to perform test input generation. A major challenge facing dynamic symbolic execution in such application is the combinatorial explosion of the path space. To address this fundamental scalability issue, we employ data dependence analysis to identify a root cause leading to the execution of the goal and propose a path exploration algorithm to guide dynamic symbolic execution for effectively discovering the goal.
